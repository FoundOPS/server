1. Replace all NONCLUSTERED w CLUSTERED

Constraint Fixes

Ex. FK_RouteTaskRouteDestination replace with ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE NO ACTION;

Where the FK_RouteTaskRouteDestination constraint is in the edmx.sql:
replace the last line "ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION" with "ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE NO ACTION"

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[RouteTasks]
ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_RouteTaskRouteDestination]
    FOREIGN KEY ([RouteDestinationId])
    REFERENCES [dbo].[RouteDestinations]
        ([Id])
ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE NO ACTION; 

2. FK_RouteTaskRouteDestination replace with ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will remove RouteTasks from a destination when it is deleted

3. FK_ServiceTemplateField replace with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Fields from a ServiceTemplate when it is deleted

4. FK_LocationFieldLocation replace with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete LocationFields when a Location is deleted

5. FK_OptionsFieldOption replace with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete OptionsField when a Option is deleted

6. FK_OptionsField_inherits_Field with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Field when a OptionsField is deleted

7. FK_LocationField_inherits_Field with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Field when a LocationsField is deleted

8. FK_TextBoxField_inherits_Field with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Field when a TextBoxField is deleted

9. FK_NumericField_inherits_Field with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Field when a NumericField is deleted

10. FK_DateTimeField_inherits_Field with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Field when a DateTimeField is deleted

11. FK_LocationOption_inherits_Option with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Option when a LocationOption is deleted

12. FK_InvoiceServiceTemplate with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete Invoice when a ServiceTemplate is deleted

13. FK_RecurringServiceServiceTemplate with ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION; //This will delete RecurringService when a ServiceTemplate is deleted
